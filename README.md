# This project aims to build a movie recommender system based on word vector similarity. By analyzing the descriptions of different movies, the system will suggest which movies a user should watch next. In this example, we will use the movie description of "Planet Hulk" to recommend similar movies.

# To run this project locally, please follow the instructions below:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/ECI25/finalCapstone.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd finalCapstone



# Run the watch_next.py script:
 python watch_next.py

The script will read the movie descriptions from the movies.txt file and prompt you to enter a description for the movie you have watched. Provide the description and press Enter.

The system will calculate the similarity between the input description and the descriptions of other movies. It will then display the title of the most similar movie as the recommendation.

You can repeat the process by entering different movie descriptions and receiving new recommendations.
